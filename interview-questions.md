# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer:
The method super is used when working with classes that are a parent of other classes.

  Researched answer:
The super method is used to pass attributes down to child classes.


2. What is a virtual DOM?

  Your answer:
A virtual DOM is a library that holds components to be used by a developer.

  Researched answer:
A virtual DOM is where an ideal is stored in memory that is easier and faster to access, to later be called upon by a library such as React to execute a code without refresh.



3. When creating a basic (stateless) class component in React, what are the necessary elements needed to display "Hello World" in the browser?

  Your answer:
Inside React, you must have empty tags <> </> surrounding the tags that hold "Hello World".

  Researched answer:
React requires an import, a class to reference (without a state in this case), a render which includes a return, react fragments (empty tags <></>), and an export.


4. What is JSX?

  Your answer:
JSX is javascript language that is used inside of html tags in a React application.

  Researched answer:
JSX is incorporating javascript logic and language into html using a classname.  This allows us to render javascript logic inside of react seamlessly without reload.


5. What is state in React?

  Your answer:
State is linking CSS and other React components together.

  Researched answer:
State is an object of information that becomes available to all components.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
Hoisting is holding the information of a section of code until called later in the program.

  Researched answer:
Hoisting is declaring a variable with let or const after it is called in a function with the intent that javascript will "hoist" or move the variable to a reference memory at the beginning of code before executing the command.
